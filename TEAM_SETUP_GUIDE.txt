TEAM SETUP - USING SHARED MONGODB ATLAS
========================================

You're using your teammate's MongoDB Atlas setup. Here's what you need to know:

✅ WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE:
-------------------------
1. MongoDB connection string from teammate ✓
2. All API keys (Google, Voyage) ✓
3. .env file configured ✓

✅ WHAT WAS ADDED:
------------------
MONGODB_DB_NAME=juris

This is just the name of the database. MongoDB will create it automatically.
You don't need to do anything in MongoDB Atlas.

📋 YOUR CURRENT .ENV:
---------------------
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyCoTkPoAD4BobHddKqweYpbB6xlalFJY0s
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://suleyman_db_user:XfkIhSSJfENM4Khh@juriscluster.dfgcoqu.mongodb.net/?appName=JurisCluster
MONGODB_DB_NAME=juris
VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-6INyJ3E_jAqCPcF8v_XGZ_7ZC2g3J7kra1SrCiCTdsp

🚀 YOU'RE READY TO START!
--------------------------

1. Install backend dependencies (if not already done):
   cd /home/karimelbasiouni712/Delta-Hacks-12
   pip install -r auth-requirements.txt

2. Start auth-enabled backend server:
   python auth_server.py
   
   Or with uvicorn:
   uvicorn auth_server:app --reload

3. Start frontend (new terminal):
   cd web
   npm install
   npm run dev

4. Test authentication:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/register
   - Create an account
   - Should redirect to dashboard!

🔍 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START:
--------------------------------
1. Backend connects to your teammate's MongoDB cluster
2. Creates "juris" database (if it doesn't exist)
3. Creates "users" collection (if it doesn't exist)
4. Creates "sessions" collection (if it doesn't exist)
5. Adds indexes automatically
6. Ready to register users!

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
-------------------
- You're using the SAME MongoDB as your teammate
- Any users you create will be visible to your teammate
- Any data your teammate creates will be visible to you
- This is PERFECT for team collaboration!

💡 DATABASE ORGANIZATION:
-------------------------
Your shared cluster will look like this:

JurisCluster (teammate's cluster)
├── juris (your auth database)
│   ├── users (created automatically)
│   └── sessions (created automatically)
└── [any other databases your teammate has]

Each database is separate, so your auth data won't interfere with other projects.

🤝 WORKING AS A TEAM:
---------------------
- You share: MongoDB cluster, API keys
- You each have: Your own registered user accounts
- Both can: Register, login, test features
- Data is: Shared in the same database

This is the correct setup for collaborative development!

✅ NO ACTION NEEDED IN MONGODB ATLAS:
-------------------------------------
You do NOT need to:
- Create an account
- Create a cluster
- Create a database
- Create collections
- Add IP addresses
- Create users in Atlas

Everything is handled by your teammate's setup and the application code.

🎯 NEXT STEP:
-------------
Start the servers and test! See QUICKSTART_AUTH.txt for commands.
