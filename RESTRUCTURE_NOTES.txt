IMPORTANT: NO EXISTING FILES MODIFIED
=====================================

This authentication system has been restructured to AVOID modifying
any of your existing project files to prevent merge conflicts.

✅ WHAT WAS CHANGED FROM ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION:
=================================================

1. FOLDER STRUCTURE CHANGED:
   ❌ OLD: agent/auth/
   ✅ NEW: auth/ (top-level folder)
   
   Auth is now a separate module, not nested under agent.

2. NO MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING FILES:
   ✅ agent/server.py - UNTOUCHED (original preserved)
   ✅ agent/requirements.txt - UNTOUCHED (original preserved)
   ✅ All other agent files - UNTOUCHED

3. NEW FILES CREATED INSTEAD:
   ✅ auth_server.py - NEW server that wraps original
   ✅ auth-requirements.txt - Separate auth dependencies
   ✅ protected_routes.py - Protected endpoints (top-level)
   ✅ .env.example - Environment template (top-level)

🚀 HOW TO USE:
==============

1. Install Auth Dependencies (Separate from main project):
   pip install -r auth-requirements.txt

2. Start Auth-Enabled Server:
   python auth_server.py
   
   Or:
   uvicorn auth_server:app --reload

3. Start Frontend:
   cd web
   npm run dev

⚡ RUNNING ORIGINAL SERVER (Without Auth):
==========================================

If you want to run your original server without auth:
   cd agent
   python -m uvicorn server:app --reload

The original functionality is completely preserved.

🔄 HOW AUTH_SERVER.PY WORKS:
============================

auth_server.py:
1. Imports your original server.py (unchanged)
2. Imports auth routes
3. Combines them into a new FastAPI app
4. Exposes all endpoints:
   - Original: /chat, /health
   - New: /auth/*, /api/*

This way:
✅ No merge conflicts with teammates
✅ Original server still works independently
✅ Auth is completely modular and separate
✅ Easy to remove if needed

🔧 MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION:
==============================

Your teammates can:
1. Pull latest code
2. Continue using agent/server.py unchanged
3. Optionally adopt auth by running auth_server.py
4. No conflicts with agent/ directory files

Git status should show:
- agent/server.py - unchanged
- agent/requirements.txt - unchanged
- auth/ - new files (untracked)
- auth_server.py - new file (untracked)
- web/app/ - new pages (untracked)

📋 INSTALLATION SUMMARY:
========================

For Team Members Who Want Auth:
   pip install -r auth-requirements.txt
   python auth_server.py

For Team Members Who Don't:
   cd agent
   python -m uvicorn server:app --reload

Both options work! Auth is opt-in.

✅ DEPENDENCIES MANAGEMENT:
===========================

Main Project (agent/requirements.txt):
- Unchanged
- Contains AI/LangGraph dependencies
- Used by: agent/server.py

Auth System (auth-requirements.txt):
- bcrypt (password hashing)
- email-validator (email validation)
- References: pymongo, fastapi (already in main)
- Used by: auth_server.py

No overlap, no conflicts!

🎯 KEY BENEFITS OF THIS STRUCTURE:
===================================

1. ✅ No merge conflicts
2. ✅ Original code untouched
3. ✅ Auth is modular and removable
4. ✅ Team members can opt-in or out
5. ✅ Easy to test both with and without auth
6. ✅ Clear separation of concerns
